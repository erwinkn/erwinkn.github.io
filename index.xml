It provides a general introduction to the subject, with some surprising facts I discovered along the way.
This is a personal perspective and is subject to change based on feedback and further discussions. Feel free to reach out!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for the past few months with Vicat (sidenote: For the anecdote, Louis Vicat is the inventor of one of the first modern cement formulations in 1817!</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://erwinkn.com/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erwinkn.com/about/</guid><description>TL;DR I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly passionate about climate, computer science, food &amp;amp; wine, climbing, technology and science fiction. Pick any topic in there and I&amp;rsquo;m happy to talk hours about it!
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on data markets and blockchains, been a food photographer and am now focusing on writing code for the climate.</description></item><item><title>Now</title><link>https://erwinkn.com/now/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://erwinkn.com/now/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working with Vicat on how to get to net-zero emissions in the cement industry. With them, I&amp;rsquo;m building N-Zero, a modelling tool to create long term roadmaps towards net-zero CO2 emissions. While the project is private, I wrote a primer on the cement &amp;amp; concrete industries from a climate lens here.
I recently caught the deep learning bug as well. Right now, I&amp;rsquo;m working on mini-dl, an educational deep learning framework built on top of JAX and simple-grad, an introduction going from zero to a complete auto-differentiation system, similar to what PyTorch or JAX use under the hood.</description></item></channel></rss>
