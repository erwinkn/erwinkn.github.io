More specifically, we are developing N-Zero, a modelling tool to create roadmaps towards carbon neutral cement. Coming from the computer science world, I had to learn everything along the way and I quickly became fascinated.</p><p>Whenever I talk about my work, people often note that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s great that the industry is making progress on climate questions, but don&rsquo;t forget: <em>it&rsquo;s still concrete after all</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>In this series, I want to unpack this observation. Especially the assumptions behind it. Why is concrete harmful? How is it harmful? Can &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; concrete actually mean something? If so, how will the buildings and the material world around us evolve in response?</p><p>I will answer these questions in three parts. The first article sets the decor for the discussion, including a few facts that really surprised me as I was learning about the subject. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t understand how fundamental concrete is for our civilization before I started working on it.</p><p>The second article will focus on the technologies and actions that can lead us to reduce the carbon footprint of concrete. It will start from zero and go in-depth on each subject, leveraging some of my modelling work.</p><p>The third article will border on science fiction. I&rsquo;m interested in imagining the future of the construction industry (with a special emphasis on concrete obviously). What would carbon-neutral buildings be made of, and look like? Will there still be concrete? It won&rsquo;t be exhaustive but I have a handful of ideas I want to explore.</p><h2 id=the-difference-between-cement-and-concrete>The difference between cement and concrete</h2><p>Before we go any further, I want to answer a question I get asked very often: what is the difference between cement and concrete?</p><p>Simply put, concrete is what you pour to build things and cement is the glue that holds everything together. One way to understand it is the cake analogy ðŸŽ‚: if concrete is a cake, cement is the flour that holds it together.</p><p>More precisely, cement is a fine powder that is mixed with sand and crushed rocks (called &ldquo;aggregates&rdquo;) to form the concrete mix. Once the mix is hydrated, it starts to solidify and, after a short time, sets into a fixed structure.</p><figure><img src=imgs/cement-and-concrete.jpg alt="Cement powder on top of a concrete block" width=600px><figcaption><p><em>Here&rsquo;s some cement on top of a concrete block</em></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=concrete-is-everywhere>Concrete is everywhere</h2><p>Concrete is one of those materials that is so fundamental to our lives that we barely pay attention to it. It has been in use since Antiquity and modern civilisation would not have been possible without it. It is <a href=https://www.iea.org/reports/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry>the most widely used man-made substance on the planet</a> and <strong>the second most used substance overall, right behind water</strong>.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to get a sense of how much concrete we actually use.</p><p>First of all, it&rsquo;s hard to find accurate numbers for the global annual production of concrete. This is likely due to the very distributed nature of concrete manufacturing, which often happens in small production units, whereas cement is manufactured in large-scale plants, making reporting and accounting easier.</p><p>Overall, the global production of cement is over <span><input aria-label="Show sidenote" type=checkbox id=sn_check-2 class="sn_check hidden">

<span class=sr-only>)</span></small></span> Taking 2015 numbers, that&rsquo;s 626 kg of cement per person on the planet - more than the annual food consumption!</p><p>Estimations for global concrete production put it at over 10 Gt/year. Cementitious materials, which include a majority of concrete, represent around 30% of global materials use, including fossil fuels. Here&rsquo;s a chart from <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cemconres.2018.03.015>Scrivener et al. (2018)</a> that compares their use to that of other common materials:</p><figure><img src=imgs/scrivener18_materials.jpg alt="Estimated production of common materials (2002-2005)"><figcaption><p>Estimated production of common materials (2002-2005).

(2018)</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>As we can see, cementitious materials dwarf the other most common materials, like wood or iron, by far. I&rsquo;m still surprised every time I see these numbers! Sure, I knew that we use a lot of concrete - but <strong>more than all the other construction materials combined?</strong> It took me a while to interiorise these facts.</p><p>This has strong implications on our understanding on concrete and its environmental impact.</p><h2 id=the-climate-impact-of-concrete>The climate impact of concrete</h2><p>At the same time, concrete is often seen as dangerous for the environment. For good reason! The cement industry is the largest industrial emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for <a href=https://www.iea.org/reports/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry>7-8% of global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions</a>, and the third largest industrial energy consumer, representing 7% of the global industrial energy use.</p><p>One perhaps more surprising fact is that concrete actually has a relatively low energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
footprint compared to other construction materials. <a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete-0/>The Chatham House report</a> on innovation in low-carbon cement and concrete compiled data regarding the embodied energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions of construction materials in the UK, summarized in the figure below.</p><figure><img src=imgs/chatham_embodied.png alt="Embodied emissions and energy for materials used in construction in the UK"><figcaption><p>Embodied emissions and energy for materials used in construction in the UK (<a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete-0/1-introduction#paragraph-7220-title>source</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>As we can see, <strong>concrete lies on the low end for both embodied energy and embodied CO<sub>2</sub>
per kilogram.</strong> The comparison with wood is especially interesting: somehow it is more energy efficient to mine vast amounts of rock, heat it up over 1400Â°C and blend it with sand and more rocks than to cut down wood, transport it and process it. I suspect this is is likely due to the high economies of scale that can be achieved in the cement industry &mdash; both on the scale of global concrete production and the scale of individual cement plants, which generally process over a million tonnes of cement per year.</p><p>However, to be clear: this is not an entirely fair comparison, for two reasons.</p><ul><li>The data does not factor in carbon sequestration from the wood, which shifts the CO<sub>2</sub>
balance significantly (although concrete also captures CO<sub>2</sub>
, as we will see later)</li><li>Concrete is about 4x denser than wood, although both materials obviously have very different properties and the former generally achieves higher resistances per cubic meter.</li></ul><p>Still, even if we were comparing energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
footprints per cubic meter, concrete would come about equal or even below wood. The consequence is that <strong>the very large environmental footprint of the cement industry is not due to concrete being especially destructive in and of itself, but due to the incredibly high amounts of it we use as a civilization.</strong></p><figure><img src=imgs/montalieu.jpg alt="Aerial overview of Vicat's cement plant in Montalieu, France"><figcaption><p>Vicat&rsquo;s flagship plant of Montalieu, with all the state-of-the-art technological goodness</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=can-we-use-less-concrete>Can we use less concrete?</h2><p>Naturally, the first question that comes to mind once we realize the magnitude of concrete&rsquo;s environmental footprint is: can we use less of it?</p><p>The short answer to this is: no. Many people around the world still lack access to basic infrastructure such as clean water and electricity, world population is increasing and developing countries will need to build a lot more to continue improving their standards of living. About 1-in-3 people in cities are living in urban slums, with a lack of access to clean water, sanitation, sufficient living space or durable housing. 4.5 billion people, 60% of the world, do not have access to safely managed sanitation and <span><input aria-label="Show sidenote" type=checkbox id=sn_check-12 class="sn_check hidden">

(2018)</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last 65 years, global population has increased ~2.5x, while cement production has increased by over 30x, a much faster rate than other major materials like steel. Over the same time period, the world also saw the fastest increase in living standards in human history.</p><p>To quote the <a href=https://newclimateeconomy.report//2016>2016 New Climate Economy report</a> from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate:</p><blockquote><p><em>The world is expected to invest around US$90 trillion in infrastructure over the next 15 years, more than is in place in our entire current stock today.</em>
&ndash; The Sustainable Infrastructure Imperative</p></blockquote><p>Developing countries are expected to account for 2/3 of this amount.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an impressive statistic, to get a sense of what that kind of development entails:</p><figure><img src=imgs/concrete-in-china-gates.png alt="China used more cement from 2011 to 2013 than the US in the entire 20th century"><figcaption><p>Illustration taken from <a href=https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Concrete-in-China>Gates Notes</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, from 1990 to 2014, China saw its share of urban population living in slums decrease from 44% to 25%.</p><p>Given the amount of development still required to meet the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals, it seems likely &mdash; and even desirable &mdash; that cement and concrete production will keep on increasing at a rapid rate in the near future.</p><p>Coming back to concrete&rsquo;s environmental impact: if we still have a lot to build, can we maybe use less concrete to achieve those goals? Here are the two possibilities.</p><h3 id=1-can-we-replace-concrete-with-other-materials-like-wood>1) Can we replace concrete with other materials, like wood?</h3><p>Concrete has some unique properties, which make it quite hard to replace.

</span>. If our constructions last longer, we can build less and lower our environmental footprint.</li><li><strong>Insulation:</strong> higher energy efficiency in our built environment is <a href=https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/insulation>incredibly important</a> on our path to reduce global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions. Concrete has a high thermal mass and low air infiltration, both important factors in enhancing the energy efficiency of buildings.</li><li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> your regular neighborhood concrete plant is able to offer hundreds of different formulations. Every concrete plant has a different set of them, adapted to local environmental conditions. This diversity means concrete can be used anywhere on Earth, from Siberia to the Sahara, and adapted to any construction type.</li></ul><p>To my knowledge, no other construction material today can cover all the uses of concrete. Add to that the enormous amounts of it that we use every year and it seems clear that concrete is not going away.</p><h3 id=2-can-we-use-concrete-more-efficiently>2) Can we use concrete more efficiently?</h3><p>Definitely yes, for many reasons, ranging from improved construction standards and increased recycling to high-tech innovations like 3D printing.</p><p>The magnitude of impact of a more efficient use of concrete should not be underestimated. By using different types of concrete in different parts of the same structure, not overdosing cement in concrete mixes and optimising the design of structural elements, gains of <a href=https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/301843>up to 40% less embodied CO<sub>2</sub></a> could be achieved.</p><p>However, as important as efficiency improvements are, we still need to reach net-zero emissions if we hope to stabilize our climate. To achieve this goal, we need to understand where the CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions are coming from.</p><h2 id=co2problem>The CO<sub>2</sub> problem</h2><p>Concrete is particular in that nearly all of its embodied emissions come from cement production, for which the vast majority of emissions are concentrated at a single point in the manufacturing process: clinker production.</p><p>Clinker is the main component of ordinary cement and gives it its binding power. Typically, cement is composed of 70-80% clinker, gypsum, supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), which also provide binding power, and inert fillers.</p><p>Clinker is produced by heating limestone and other mineral materials, like clay, marl or shale, making up the raw meal to temperatures over 1400Â°C in the massive kilns sitting at the center of cement plants. At this point, the following chemical reaction happens:</p><p>$$\ce{CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2}$$</p><p>This is the calcination of limestone and the source of most of our problems here. The CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions coming from this chemical reaction are called <strong>process emissions</strong> and make up <strong>2/3rds of the CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions associated with cement production.</strong></p><p>Firing up a cement kiln at 1450Â°C also requires <span><input aria-label="Show sidenote" type=checkbox id=sn_check-5 class="sn_check hidden">

emissions.</strong></p><p>What this implies is that, <strong>even if we were able to operate cement plants entirely on carbon-neutral fuels, we would still be left with nearly two thirds of the emissions.</strong></p><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a detailed breakdown of the concrete manufacturing process, associated emissions and possible solutions, from the Chatham House report on innovation the cement industry:</p><figure><img src=imgs/chatham-co2-breakdown.png alt="Emissions along the cement supply chain.

Clinker production is the remaining 90%.</p><p>However, here&rsquo;s a very interesting consequence of all this: <strong>concrete absorbs CO<sub>2</sub>
from the air.</strong> The chemical reaction we&rsquo;ve seen above is actually one side of a triangle.</p><figure><img src=imgs/cement-triangle.jpg alt="Diagram showing a triangle of reactions CaCO3 -> CaO -> Ca(OH)2 -> CaCO3" width=80%><figcaption><p>The carbon cycle of concrete (<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884618301480>source</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>During clinker production, we take stable
CaCO<sub>3</sub>
in the form of limestone and turn it at high temperatures into very reactive CaO &mdash; also known as quicklime. Once it is incorporated into the concrete formulation and mixed with water, it rapidly turns into calcium hydrates
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
and solidifies.</p><p>Over the lifetime of the resulting structure, those calcium hydrates revert back to the more stable form of
CaCO<sub>3</sub>
, absorbing back the CO<sub>2</sub>
process emissions that were emitted during clinker production.</p><p>Concrete used in a building for 80 years will <a href=https://cembureau.eu/library/reports/2050-carbon-neutrality-roadmap/>absorb around 20% of the process emissions</a> associated with the clinker it contains. That&rsquo;s a lot! We will come back to this at the end of the article. It&rsquo;s worth thinking about how this unique property could be used in conjunction with the technologies described below.</p><h2 id=towards-net-zero-the-levers-of-decarbonisation>Towards net-zero: the levers of decarbonisation</h2><p>The actions and technologies that can help reduce concrete&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub>
footprint warrant a whole article of their own. However, it&rsquo;s possible to get a quick understanding of the landscape without diving too deep. So let&rsquo;s do just that!</p><p>A mental model which I find really helpful is the one given in the <a href=https://cembureau.eu/library/reports/2050-carbon-neutrality-roadmap/>2050 Carbon Neutrality Roadmap</a> from CEMBUREAU. It illustrates the five stages of the cement & concrete value chain.

footprint, it&rsquo;s possible to group nearly everything into a few categories.</p><h3 id=energy-efficiency-small-classtext-darksanguineclinker--cementsmall>Energy efficiency <small class=text-darkSanguine>(clinker & cement)</small></h3><p>Thermal and electric efficiency gains can be achieved through optimisation of industrial processes and adoption of the best-in-class kiln technologies. Overall, the potential here is minor: the <a href=https://www.iea.org/reports/technology-roadmap-low-carbon-transition-in-the-cement-industry>IEA global scenario</a> estimates a 10% gain in thermal efficiency of clinker production by 2050, corresponding to 3% of the total emissions reductions for the cement industry.</p><h3 id=fuel-substitution-small-classtext-darksanguineclinkersmall>Fuel substitution <small class=text-darkSanguine>(clinker)</small></h3><p>Fuel substitution involves switching from fossil fuels to alternative fuels, often composed of waste products. It helps build the local economy and upcycle substances that would have to handled elsewhere otherwise.</p><p>However, it&rsquo;s important to distinguish between two types of alternative fuels: biomass and non-organic waste. In our climate perspective, it&rsquo;s only the increased use of biomass that helps reduce emissions.</p><p>This is a very active area of work and <strong>one of the major levers for short term emissions reductions</strong> in the cement industry. Perhaps surprisingly, there are already European cement plants running on <a href=https://lowcarboneconomy.cembureau.eu/5-parallel-routes/resource-efficiency/alternative-fuels/>over 80% alternative fuels</a>. For instance, Vicat aims to achieve zero fossil fuels in Europe by 2025 and worlwide by 2030.</p><h3 id=clinkersubst>Clinker substitution <small class=text-darkSanguine>(cement)</small></h3><p>Since clinker production is where nearly all the CO<sub>2</sub>

accounting is a tricky business however. Currently fly ash and GBFS are considered to be 0 kgCO<sub>2</sub>

As such, the point in time at which carbon capture can be deployed widely is very uncertain. For this reason, all the other decarbonisation levers outlined here are just as crucial in a complete roadmap towards carbon neutral concrete.</p><h3 id=alternative-cement-formulations-small-classtext-darksanguineconcretesmall>Alternative cement formulations <small class=text-darkSanguine>(concrete)</small></h3><p>So far, all solutions above have focused on the regular cement process, known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement>Portland cement</a>. What about alternatives, you may ask?</p><p>There are indeed dozens of cement formulations other than Portland cement. There is however no catch-all solution that we could simply swap in. Often, the choice is strongly dependent on the construction type, as other cements have different physical properties, and the locally available materials.</p><p>In any case, nearly all alternative formulations I&rsquo;ve seen still involve either calcination of limestone or a strong reliance on fly ash or GBFS, which have their own problems (see the paragraphs on <a href=#clinkersubst>clinker substitution</a>). I will include resources on the subject at <a href=#refs>the end of this article</a>. Overall, <a href=https://ecra-online.org/research/technology-papers/>the consensus</a> seems to be that we will likely see an expansion in the types of cements available and smarter choices made on a case-by-case basis &ndash; but Portland cement will remain the vast majority of the market.</p><h3 id=smarter-use-of-concrete-small-classtext-darksanguineconstructionsmall>Smarter use of concrete <small class=text-darkSanguine>(construction)</small></h3><p>I&rsquo;ll admit this is a bit of a catch-all section. At a high-level, the goal is to reduce the % of clinker in concrete, since nearly all embodied emissions come from there. Often those solutions can be win-win and help drive down costs as well, since clinker is one of the major contributors to the cost of concrete.</p><p>Concrete use can be optimised at multiple levels:</p><ul><li><strong>Using less concrete for the same structural elements through smarter design.</strong> With an emphasis on &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;: trying to minimise concrete use is sometimes counterproductive. If you use 10% less concrete but have to pick a more resistant formulation with 20% more clinker content, you end up with a higher carbon footprint.</li><li><strong>Not overdosing cement in concrete.</strong> Using more cement than specified in official standards or technical specs in concrete is common practice. In some cases it&rsquo;s necessary because of environmental conditions, sometimes it&rsquo;s &ldquo;just to be safe&rdquo; and make everyone&rsquo;s job easier. The consequence is that concrete sometimes end up with a 10-20% higher carbon footprint than necessary.</li><li><strong>Using different types of cement and concrete,</strong> focusing on reducing total CO<sub>2</sub>
footprint. Possibilities here include changing the construction process to accomodate formulations with less clinker or using different concrete formulations in different parts of a building.</li></ul><p>There are also a number of companies building technological innovations, ranging from <a href=https://alcemy.tech/en/>optimising concrete mix</a> to <a href=https://www.carboncure.com/>curing it</a> with CO<sub>2</sub>
.</p><h2 id=beyond-net-zero>Beyond net-zero</h2><p><strong>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the year is 2050 and we&rsquo;ve achieved carbon neutral cement</strong>. We have incredibly efficient cement kilns running on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxy-fuel_combustion_process>pure oxygen</a>, producing high-quality clinker and capturing 90+% of the CO<sub>2</sub>
coming out. Due to better chemical formulations, smarter use of concrete and a necessity for the construction industry to achieve nearly zero embodied emissions, all the innovations outlined above have become the new normal.</p><p>But remember, concrete absorbs CO<sub>2</sub>
during its lifetime. This means that our buildings have not only reduced their footprint: they are now actively removing carbon from the atmosphere. Even better, we may have found ways to accelerate the recarbonation process and leverage it to achieve higher resistances with less cement. Upon destruction, the concrete remnants of old buildings are recycled, absorbing even more CO<sub>2</sub>
in the process.</p><p>Needless to say, an incredible amount of work needs to be done before we can reach that stage. But I want to keep this in mind: this is what the future could look like. <strong>Over the course of a few decades, the concrete industry could go from the most carbon-intensive industrial sector to being one of the major sinks of CO<sub>2</sub>
in the world.</strong></p><p>Concrete is one of the most crucial sectors in our transition to a carbon-neutral world and is deeply fascinating. Yet, I feel it is often overlooked compared to other areas of interest in discussions around the climate. I highly encourage ambitious folks to come tackle the problem, both within existing organisations, and by building new ones. There&rsquo;s a real shift in the industry right now. The questions it not &ldquo;will we reach net-zero?&rdquo; anymore, but &ldquo;how will we do it?&rdquo;</p><h2 id=refs>References</h2><p>I have linked many references in this article, but a few reports and papers have been crucial to shape my understanding of the subject. If you&rsquo;re interested in diving deeper, here are my recommandations:</p><ul><li>As an introduction to the subject, <a href=https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete-0/1-introduction>the first chapter of Making Concrete Change</a> from Chatham House is fantastic.
