Coming from the computer science world, I had to learn everything along the way and I quickly became fascinated.</p><p>Whenever I talk about my work, people are quick to note that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s great that the industry is making progress on the climate problem, but don&rsquo;t forget: <em>it&rsquo;s still concrete after all</em>.&rdquo; I mean, I even get stopped at organic food markets when I go there with a Vicat shopping bag.</p><p>I want to unpack this observation and the assumptions behind it. Why is concrete harmful? How is it harmful? Can &ldquo;eco-friendly&rdquo; concrete actually mean something? Or is there something inherently problematic with it? Can we solve this problem? If so, how will the buildings and the material world around us evolve in response?</p><p>Over time, I also developed a certain vision of the future around these questions. The cement & concrete industry is one of the toughest sectors when it comes to CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions reductions. Yet, I think it also holds a great promise for the future, if the (very hard) work is done. Let me unpack what I mean by that.</p><h2 id=the-difference-between-cement-and-concrete>The difference between cement and concrete</h2><p>Before we go any further, I just want to answer one of the questions I get asked the most: what is the difference between cement and concrete?</p><p>Simply put, concrete is what you pour to build things and cement is the glue that holds everything together. One way to understand it is the cake analogy ðŸŽ‚: if concrete is a cake, cement is the flour that holds it together.</p><p>More precisely, cement is a fine powder that is mixed with sand and crushed rocks (called &ldquo;aggregates&rdquo;) to form the concrete mix. Once the mix is hydrated, it starts to solidify and, after a short time, sets into a fixed structure.</p><figure><img src=imgs/cement-and-concrete.jpg alt="Cement powder on top of a concrete block" width=600px><figcaption><p><em>Here&rsquo;s some cement on top of a concrete block</em></p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=concrete-is-everywhere>Concrete is everywhere</h2><p>Concrete is one of those materials that is so fundamental to our lives that we barely pay attention to it.

Here&rsquo;s a chart from Scrivener et al.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> that compares their use to that of other common materials:</p><figure><img src=imgs/scrivener18_materials.jpg alt="Estimated production of common materials (2002-2005)" width=80%><figcaption><p>Estimated production of common materials (2002-2005).

(2018)</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>As we can see, cementitious materials dwarf the other most common materials, like wood or iron, by far. I&rsquo;m still surprised every time I see these numbers! Sure, I knew that we use a lot of concrete - but <strong>more than all the other construction materials combined?</strong> It took me a while to interiorise these facts.</p><p>This has strong implications on the way we should understand our dependence on concrete and its environmental impact.</p><h2 id=concrete-and-climate>Concrete and climate</h2><p>At the same time, concrete is often seen as dangerous for the environment. For good reason! The cement industry is the largest industrial emitter of greenhouse gas emissions, responsible for 7-8% of global CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, and the third largest industrial energy consumer, representing 7% of the global industrial energy use.</p><p>One perhaps more surprising fact is that concrete actually has a relatively low energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
footprint compared to other construction materials. The Chatham House report<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> on innovation in low-carbon cement and concrete compiled data regarding the embodied energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions of construction materials in the UK, summarized in the figure below.</p><figure><img src=imgs/chatham_embodied.png alt="Embodied emissions and energy for materials used in construction in the UK"><figcaption><p>Embodied emissions and energy for materials used in construction in the UK ((source)[https://www.chathamhouse.org/2018/06/making-concrete-change-innovation-low-carbon-cement-and-concrete-0/1-introduction#paragraph-7220-title])</p></figcaption></figure><p>As we can see, <strong>concrete lies on the low end for both embodied energy and embodied CO<sub>2</sub>
.</strong> The comparison with wood is especially interesting: somehow it is more energy efficient to mine vast amounts of rock, heat it up over 1400Â°C and blend it with sand and more rocks than to cut down wood, transport it and process it. I suspect this is is likely due to the high economies of scale that can be achieved in the cement industry &mdash; both on the scale of global concrete production and the scale of individual cement plants, which generally process over a million tonnes of cement per year.</p><p>However, to be clear: this is not an entirely fair comparison, for two reasons.</p><ul><li>The data does not factor in carbon sequestration from the wood, which shifts the CO<sub>2</sub>
balance significantly (although concrete also captures CO<sub>2</sub>
, as we will see later)</li><li>Concrete is about 4x denser than wood, although both materials obviously have very different properties and the former generally achieves higher resistances per cubic meter.</li></ul><p>Still, even if we were comparing energy and CO<sub>2</sub>
footprints per cubic meter, concrete would come about equal or even below wood. The consequence is that <strong>the very large environmental footprint of the cement industry is not due to concrete being especially destructive in and of itself, but due to the incredibly high amounts of it we use as a civilization.</strong></p><figure><img src=imgs/montalieu_tour.jpg alt="Cement kiln and preheater tower" height=800px><figcaption><p>What a cement plant looks like: rotary kiln and preheater tower at Vicat&rsquo;s state-of-the-art Montalieu plant</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=can-we-use-less-concrete>Can we use less concrete?</h2><p>Naturally, the first question that comes to mind once we realize the magnitude of concrete&rsquo;s environmental footprint is: can we use less of it?</p><p>The short answer to this is: no. Many people around the world still lack access to basic infrastructure such as clean water and electricity, world population is increasing and developing countries will need to build a lot more to continue improving their standards of living. About 1-in-3 people in cities are living in urban slums, with a lack of access to clean water, sanitation, sufficient living space or durable housing. 4.5 billion people, 60% of the world, do not have access to safely managed sanitation and 2.1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water.<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> The amount of infrastructure development that still needs to happen for the whole world to reach decent living standards is staggering.</p><p>As often, it&rsquo;s helpful to look at historical trends to try and get a sense of where we are headed. Here is a graph showing world population, cement production and steel production from 1950 to 2015:<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><figure><img src=imgs/scrivener18_cementprod.jpg alt="World population, cement production and steel production (1950-2015).From Scrivener et al.

(2018)</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Over the last 65 years, global population has increased by less than 3x, while cement production has increased by over 30x, a much faster rate than other major materials like steel. Over the same time period, the world also saw the fastest increase in living standards in human history.</p><p>To quote the <a href=https://newclimateeconomy.report//2016>2016 New Climate Economy report</a> from the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate:</p><blockquote><p><em>The world is expected to invest around US$90 trillion in infrastructure over the next 15 years, more than is in place in our entire current stock today.</em>
&ndash; The Sustainable Infrastructure Imperative</p></blockquote><p>Developing countries are expected to account for 2/3 of this amount.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s an impressive statistic, to get a sense of what that kind of development entails:[^Gates]</p><figure><img src=imgs/concrete-in-china-gates.png alt="China used more cement from 2011 to 2013 than the US in the entire 20th century"><figcaption><p>Illustration taken from <a href=https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/Concrete-in-China>Gates Notes</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, from 1990 to 2014, China saw its share of urban population living in slums decrease from 44% to 25%.</p><p>Given the amount of development still required to meet the UN&rsquo;s Sustainable Development Goals, it seems likely &mdash; and even desirable &mdash; that cement and concrete production will keep on increasing at a rapid rate in the near future.</p><p>Coming back to concrete&rsquo;s environmental impact: if we still have a lot to build, can we maybe use less concrete to achieve those goals?

For instance, the latter could allow us to manufacture the same structural element with up to 50% less concrete.</p><p>However, as important as efficiency improvements are, we still need to reach net-zero emissions if we hope to stabilize our climate. To achieve this goal, we need to understand where the CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions are coming from.</p><h2 id=co2problem>The CO<sub>2</sub>
problem</h2><p>Concrete is particular in that nearly all of its embodied emissions come from cement production, for which the vast majority of emissions are concentrated at a single point in the manufacturing process: clinker production.</p><p>Clinker is the main component of ordinary cement and gives it its binding power. Typically, cement is composed of 70-80% clinker, gypsum, supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), which also provide binding power, and inert fillers.</p><p>Clinker is produced by heating limestone and other mineral materials, like clay, marl or shale, making up the raw meal to temperatures over 1400Â°C in the massive kilns sitting at the center of cement plants. At this point, the following chemical reaction happens:</p><p>$$\ce{CaCO3 -> CaO + CO2}$$</p><p>This is the calcination of limestone and the source of most of our problems here. The CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions coming from this chemical reaction are called <strong>process emissions</strong> and make up 50 to 60% of the CO<sub>2</sub>

Clinker production is the remaining 90%.</p><h2 id=towards-net-zero>Towards net-zero</h2><p>Across the whole spectrum of technologies and actions that are relevant to reducing concrete&rsquo;s CO<sub>2</sub>
footprint, there are roughly 5 categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Energy efficiency gains</strong> through optimisation of industrial processes.</li><li><strong>Fuel substitution,</strong> switching from fossil fuels to alternative fuels.</li><li><strong>Clinker substitution:</strong> replacing the most CO<sub>2</sub>
intensive component of cement with other materials</li><li><strong>Carbon capture:</strong> capturing the CO<sub>2</sub>
coming out of the cement plant.</li><li><strong>Novel cements:</strong> develop formulations less reliant on the calcination of limestone.</li></ul><p>Let&rsquo;s go through them and try to estimate the potential of each approach.</p><h3 id=energy-efficiency>Energy efficiency</h3><p>As mentioned above, most of the energy is consumed during clinker production. Energy efficiency measures therefore mostly focus on improving cement plant processes. While energy efficiency cannot bring us to net-zero by itself, it can deliver CO<sub>2</sub>

</span>: modern dry kilns use up to 50% less energy than the long wet kilns that were used in the 70s.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup></p><p><strong>Beyond those large upgrades, further improvements are unlikely to be very significant:</strong> best available technology (BAT) today already reaches over 60% efficiency compared to the theoretical minimum energy required for clinker production.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> <strong>Best-in-class cement kilns actually are some of the most efficient thermal machines in wide-scale industrial use today.</strong></p><p>Small efficiency gains, such as improved use of waste heat, can be important in enabling other projects to become cost-effective, but their effective impact will only be a few percentage points. In fact, other measures, such as increased use of alternative fuels, will likely lead to increased energy use per ton of clinker overall.</p><p>Overall, the IEA roadmap for a low-carbon transition in the cement industry<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> estimates a decrease of 10% in the global average thermal energy use per ton of clinker by 2050, corresponding to 3% of the total CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions reductions required for the cement industry in a 2Â°C scenario.</p><h3 id=alternative-fuels>Alternative fuels</h3><p>The high temperatures required by cement kilns are both a blessing and a curse when it comes to replacing fossil fuels.</p><p>On one hand, they allow the incineration of waste that can&rsquo;t be recycled elsewhere in an efficient manner, since the waste ends up providing the thermal energy required for clinker production. Common examples include old tyres, industrial waste, non-recyclable plastics or paper residues or waste oils. This also plugs cement manufacturers into the local circular economy, which has a lot of additional social and economic benefits for the region.</p><p>On the other hand, reaching temperatures over 1400Â°C requires fuels with a high energy density, which most waste types do not have. Achieving levels of 60% or even 80% alternative fuels then requires additional treatment, such as pre-drying, and degrades the thermal efficiency of the cement kiln.</p><p>Perhaps surprisingly, <strong>0% fossil fuels in the cement industry is something that will happen very soon</strong> in some parts of the world: I know that Vicat aims to achieve it by 2025 in France and 2030 in Europe, while other manufacturers are on a similar trajectory. Other regions of the world may take longer ; however, this illustrates that the bottleneck is not a technological one, but an economic one, as enough waste with the appropriate properties needs to be collected and supplied locally.</p><p>Overall, fuel substitution is an important area of work in the cement industry today and <strong>one of the main levers, alongside clinker substitution, to deliver CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions reductions in the near future</strong> while more transformative technologies, such as carbon capture, are being developed.</p><h3 id=clinker-substitution>Clinker substitution</h3><p>Clinker is not only the major component of cement, but also what provides it with binding power. The clinker ratio, defined as the % of clinker in the final cement blend, is a strong indicator of mechanical strength and durability of the resulting cement, in the absence of other substitution materials.</p><p>Replacing clinker therefore requires finding supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that can fulfill the same function of hardening upon hydration. Currently, the main candidates for that role are:</p><ul><li>Fly ash, a by-product of coal plants</li><li>Granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), a by-product of steel production</li><li>Calcined clays, produced by reacting natural clays at 700-850Â°C</li><li>Other pozzolanic materials, such as natural volcanic rocks, vegetable ashes or byproducts of silicon production</li></ul><p>The first two are the most commonly used clinker alternatives today and are sometimes used up to 50%, or even 70% for GBFS, of the final cement mix. The problem is that they are byproducts of CO<sub>2</sub>
intensive industries and their supply will likely go down in the future, either as the whole industry winds down (in the case of coal) or switches to other processes (in the case of steel).<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p>Calcined clays seem to be the most promising avenue for sustainable clinker substitution in the long-term. Their geological supply is more than sufficient to cover even a large part of worlwide clinker demand<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> and the cement industry will be able to leverage existing operational knowledge for the calcination process.</p><figure><img src=imgs/scrivener18_clinker-substitution.jpg alt="Current use and estimated supply of SCMs and fillers"><figcaption><h4>Current use and estimated supply of SCMs and fillers</h4></figcaption></figure><p>My mental model for clinker substitution includes two different roles:</p><ol><li><strong>Short term:</strong> an incredibly important lever to deliver strong reductions in the CO<sub>2</sub>
intensity of concrete and cement</li><li><strong>Long term:</strong> a way to mitigate the strong energetic and financial impact of carbon capture, by reducing the amount of expensive clinker required to produce a ton of cement.</li></ol><p>However, it is unlikely that we start replacing the majority of clinker with other materials, even by 2050. This is due to a combination of factors, like the uncertain future supply of fly ash and GBFS, the impact on mechanical properties of a high percentage of SCMs and the variations in local conditions, which may make high levels of clinker substitution technically or economically unsustainable.

before it reaches the atmosphere.</strong></p><p>In fact, cement plants are uniquely well-suited for carbon capture: they are large-scale installations with a <span><input aria-label="Show sidenote" type=checkbox id=sn_check-7 class="sn_check hidden">

Depending on the technology, it would increase thermal or electric demand up to 100% and cost around 50 to 100â‚¬ per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>
captured.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, carbon capture technologies are still immature: estimations of their potential impact on the production process and financial costs are uncertain at best and investments in the billions will be required before they are ready to be brought to market.</p><p>Another important question will need to be answered before they can be deployed at scale: what should we do with all the captured CO<sub>2</sub>
?</p><p>Geological storage is an option, albeit an expensive one for plants not located near an appropriate site. In any case, heavy subsidies or a very high price on carbon will be required before CO<sub>2</sub>
storage becomes wide-spread in the industry.</p><p>Another option is to use it to manufacture some valuable product. The problem here is that the current markets for CO<sub>2</sub>
use are small and won&rsquo;t be able to scale to handle the gigatons of carbon we will need to capture in the future, both in the cement industry and outside.</p><p>Nevertheless, exciting projects are happening in the space. To give one of my favorite examples, Vicat aims to develop a pilot cement plant with integrated carbon capture and reuse of waste heat to produce hydrogen through high-temperature electrolysis. The resulting hydrogen could then be used to fuel the kiln, power electric vehicles or even recombined with the captured CO<sub>2</sub>
to produce synthetic fuels able to replace fossil fuels in hard-to-decarbonise industries such as aviation or shipping.</p><figure><img src=imgs/valome.png alt="Plans for a cement plant with integrated carbon capture and high-temperature hydrogen production"><figcaption><p>Plans for a cement plant with integrated carbon capture and high-temperature hydrogen production</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=novel-cements>Novel cements</h3><p>One might ask: if eliminating emissions from clinker is so hard, why can&rsquo;t we develop other types of cement that don&rsquo;t use clinker?</p><p>Such formulations exist and offer varying degrees of emissions reductions potential. I decided not to focus on the topic, as they are subject to various constraints which limit their potential to displace the existing clinker process. If you&rsquo;re interested in the subject, an excellent review can be found in the work of <a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884618301480>Scrivener et al. (2018)</a>.</p><p>To summarize common limitations of alternative cements:</p><ul><li>Nearly all have different or inferior physical properties, which often make them only suitable for relatively small niche markets.</li><li>Some of them rely on pozzolanic materials such as fly ash or GBFS, whose supply is already lacking for their use as clinker substitutes.</li><li>Others are dependent on unproven production processes, which could even result in higher process emissions in some cases, unless some breakthrough is achieved.</li><li>Existing construction standards all rely on the mechanical properties of Portland cement. Testing and approving new materials can take over a decade.</li></ul><p>For these reasons, Portland cement will very likely constitute the majority of the market for the foreseeable future. In other words, we will have to find a way to decarbonise the existing clinker production, no matter what.</p><h2 id=beyond-net-zero>Beyond net-zero</h2><p>There is something very important I have not mentioned until now. Concrete actually captures CO<sub>2</sub>
from the air during its lifetime. Quite a significant amount of it actually.</p><p>The reason is simple: the chemical reaction introduced in the <a href=#co2problem>CO<sub>2</sub>
problem</a> is one side of a triangle.</p><figure><img src=imgs/scrivener18_calcium-triangle.jpg alt="Diagram showing a triangle of reactions CaCO3 -> CaO -> Ca(OH)2 -> CaCO3" width=80%><figcaption><p>The carbon cycle of concrete (<a href=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884618301480>source</a>)</p></figcaption></figure><p>During clinker production, we take very stable
CaCO<sub>3</sub>
in the form of limestone and turn it at high temperatures into very reactive CaO &mdash; also known as quicklime. Once it is incorporated into the concrete formulation and mixed with water, it rapidly turns into calcium hydrates
Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>
and solidifies.</p><p>However, over the lifetime of the resulting structure, those calcium hydrates revert back to the more stable form of
CaCO<sub>3</sub>
, absorbing back the CO<sub>2</sub>
process emissions that were emitted during clinker production.</p><p>Concrete used in a building for 80 years will absorb around 20% of the process emissions associated with the clinker it contains.</p><p>This carbon uptake can be <a href=https://fastcarb.fr/en/home/>further enhanced</a> by retrieving the cement contained in the concrete, grinding it into a fine powder and putting it into a CO<sub>2</sub>
-rich atmosphere, where it will absorb another 20 to 25% of process emissions. Through this process, the old cement mineralizes back into rock, that can then be used as aggregates alongside fresh cement to produce new concrete.</p><figure><img src=imgs/concrete-cycle.png alt="Recycling concrete while enhancing CO2 uptake.

in a permanent manner, in order to definitely remove it from the atmosphere.</p><p>Concrete captures carbon through mineralization and turns it into very stable
CaCO<sub>3</sub>
. Due to higher concentrations, capturing CO<sub>2</sub>
coming out of cement plants is easier than taking it out of the atmosphere and would still enable important, albeit delayed, carbon sequestration in the produced concrete. This means that in the long-term, <strong>concrete could become one of the major sources of carbon sequestration in the world.</strong></p><p>How&rsquo;s that for a reversal of situation?</p><h2 id=summing-up>Summing up</h2><p>Coming back down to Earth, it is necessary to acknowledge that the cement industry has historically been very conservative and slow to change &mdash; for good reasons, but they are not sufficient anymore. The very nature of the production process makes deep CO<sub>2</sub>
emissions reductions especially challenging to achieve and massive investments will be required.</p><p>Concrete is one of the most crucial sectors in our transition to a carbon-neutral world and is deeply fascinating &mdash; yet I feel it is often overlooked compared to other areas of interest in the climate fight. I highly encourage many ambitious folks to tackle the subject, both within existing organisations and by building new ones.</p><p>I also have to admit that I have been pleasantly surprised by the ongoing work I have discovered from within the industry.
