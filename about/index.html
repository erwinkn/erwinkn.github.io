                I'm incredibly passionate about climate, computer science, food & wine, climbing, technology and science
                fiction.
                Pick any topic in there and I'm happy to talk hours about it.
            </p>

                I've worked on
                <a href="https://www.dawex.com/en/">
                    data markets</a>
                and

                for the climate.

            Things I've done
        </h1>
        <section class="mt-4 prose xl:prose-lg">
            <p>
                I'm a software builder by vocation, but being of the generalist type,
                I've dabbled in a variety of different areas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most recently, I have been working with
                <a href="https://www.vicat.fr/">Vicat</a>
                on developing <span class="font-medium">N-Zero</span>, an in-house tool for modelling long term trajectories towards carbon neutrality in the cement industry.
                The goal is to create a common framework for all stakeholders to think together about the impacts of the actions and technologies that will be necessary to curb CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same time, I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique with a Master's in computer science and from ENSTA Paris with a Master's in energy systems in 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my studies, I have also been a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erwin_kuhn_/">food photographer</a> and Instagram influencer (although that one wasn't exactly planned) for 2 years.
                I started not knowing anything about photography, just with a passion for food.
                In the end, I grew my own page up to 20k followers and worked with <a href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/">The Infatuation</a> to kickstart and manage their Paris account.
            </p>
            <p>
                That experience has been one the most formative in my life. I discovered a completely new world and learned how to navigate and strategize within it.
                At the same time, I deepened my appreciation and love for our food systems and met a lot of dear friends. The food and restaurant industries are still very close to my heart today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two other great passions of mine have been data markets and blockchain protocols. Like many others, I first heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum at the beginning of 2018 and quickly got sucked down the rabbit hole.
                Around the same time, I got in touch with <a href="https://www.dawex.com/">Dawex</a>, who were developing a B2B data marketplace. During my internship there, I worked on developing the initial
                product concept for a personal data platform. Questions of privacy, data sovereignty and decentralization were never far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly after that, I started exchanging ideas with the team at <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>.
                I was especially interested in the economics of data markets,
                since I had observed at Dawex that a major hurdle to their development was the inability for providers to price their data.
                I ended up interning for 6 months at Ocean to do research on the subject.
                It has been fascinating to see some of the crazy ideas we discussed at the time materialize in the last year,
                with
                <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">
                    decentralized data exchanges
                </a>
                and
                <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">
                    cryptocurrency tokens representing datasets</a>.
