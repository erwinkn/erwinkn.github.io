I've dabbled in a variety of different areas.</p><p class=mt-3>Most recently, I have been working with
<a class=body-link href=https://www.vicat.fr/>Vicat</a>
on developing <span class=font-medium>N-Zero</span>, an in-house tool for modelling long term trajectories towards carbon neutrality in the <span><input aria-label="Show sidenote" type=checkbox id=sn_check-1 class="sn_check hidden">

The goal is to create a common framework for all stakeholders to think together about the impacts of the actions and technologies that will be necessary to curb CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p><p class=mt-3>Around the same time, I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique with a Master's in computer science and from ENSTA Paris with a Master's in energy systems in 2020.</p><p class=mt-3>During my studies, I have also been a <a class=body-link href=https://www.instagram.com/erwin_kuhn_/>food photographer</a> and Instagram influencer (although that one wasn't exactly planned) for 2 years.
I started not knowing anything about photography, just with a passion for food.
In the end, I grew my own page up to 20k followers and worked with <a class=body-link href=https://www.theinfatuation.com/>The Infatuation</a> to kickstart and manage their Paris account.</p><p class=mt-3>That experience has been one the most formative in my life. I discovered a completely new world and learned how to navigate and strategize within it.
At the same time, I deepened my appreciation and love for our food systems and met a lot of dear friends. The food and restaurant industries are still very close to my heart today.</p><p class=mt-3>Two other great passions of mine have been data markets and blockchain protocols. Like many others, I first heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum at the beginning of 2018 and quickly got sucked down the rabbit hole.
Around the same time, I got in touch with <a class=body-link href=https://www.dawex.com/>Dawex</a>, who were developing a B2B data marketplace. During my internship there, I worked on developing the initial
product concept for a personal data platform. Questions of privacy, data sovereignty and decentralization were never far.</p><p class=mt-3>Shortly after that, I started exchanging ideas with the team at <a class=body-link href=https://oceanprotocol.com/>Ocean Protocol</a>.
I was especially interested in the economics of data markets,
since I had observed at Dawex that a major hurdle to their development was the inability for providers to price their data.
I ended up interning for 6 months at Ocean to do research on the subject.
It has been fascinating to see some of the crazy ideas we discussed at the time materialize in the last year,
