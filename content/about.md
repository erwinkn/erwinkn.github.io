# TL;DR
I'm **incredibly passionate** about climate, computer science, food & wine, climbing, technology and science fiction. Pick any topic in there and I'm happy to talk hours about it!

I've worked on [data markets](https://oceanprotocol.com/) and blockchains, been a [food photographer](https://www.instagram.com/erwin_kuhn_/) and am [now](/now/) focusing on writing code for the climate.
