I'm currently on the lookout for opportunities to work on climate solutions, feel free to [reach out](mailto:erwinkn@pm.me)!

I'm also working on [Topogether](https://topogether.com/) as a side project with friends. It's an app for outdoor climbing and collaborative cartography, as we became tired of poor climbing guide books and the lack of tools to create digital ones.

In parallel, it serves as my playground for [experimenting with conflict-free replicated data types](/getting-crdts-to-production/), with the goal of making offline & collaborative apps accessible to everyone.

[See here](/about/) for things I've done in the past :)
