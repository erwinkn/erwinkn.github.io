I'm currently working with [Vicat](https://www.vicat.fr/) on how to get to **net-zero emissions in the cement industry**. With them, I'm building N-Zero, a modelling tool to create long term roadmaps towards net-zero {{< co2 >}} emissions. While the project is private, I wrote a primer on the cement & concrete industries from a climate lens [here]({{< relref "/blog/cement" >}}).

I recently caught the deep learning bug as well. Right now, I'm working on **mini-dl**, an educational deep learning framework built on top of [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) and **simple-grad**, an introduction going from zero to a complete auto-differentiation system, similar to what PyTorch or JAX use under the hood.

I'm also very interested in anything related to reducing emissions in the construction industry and additive manufacturing (3D printing). If you're an expert on any of those topics, [please reach out](mailto:erwin.kuhn@protonmail.com)!
