                I'm incredibly passionate about climate, computer science, food & wine, climbing, technology and science

                Pick any topic in there and I'm happy to talk hours about it.

            Things I've done
        </h1>
        <p class="mt-3">
            I'm a software builder by vocation, but being of the generalist type,
            I've dabbled in a variety of different areas.
        </p>
        {{< sidenote-content id=1 >}}which represents ~8% of global emissions and will be <a class="body-link" href="/blog/cement/">very hard to decarbonise</a>{{< /sidenote-content >}}
        <p class="mt-3">
            Most recently, I have been working with
            <a class="body-link" href="https://www.vicat.fr/">Vicat</a>
            on developing <span class="font-medium">N-Zero</span>, an in-house tool for modelling long term trajectories towards carbon neutrality in the {{< sidenote id=1 >}}cement industry.{{< /sidenote >}}
            The goal is to create a common framework for all stakeholders to think together about the impacts of the actions and technologies that will be necessary to curb CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Around the same time, I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique with a Master's in computer science and from ENSTA Paris with a Master's in energy systems in 2020.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            During my studies, I have also been a <a class="body-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/erwin_kuhn_/">food photographer</a> and Instagram influencer (although that one wasn't exactly planned) for 2 years.
            I started not knowing anything about photography, just with a passion for food.
            In the end, I grew my own page up to 20k followers and worked with <a class="body-link" href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/">The Infatuation</a> to kickstart and manage their Paris account.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            That experience has been one the most formative in my life. I discovered a completely new world and learned how to navigate and strategize within it.
            At the same time, I deepened my appreciation and love for our food systems and met a lot of dear friends. The food and restaurant industries are still very close to my heart today.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Two other great passions of mine have been data markets and blockchain protocols. Like many others, I first heard of Bitcoin and Ethereum at the beginning of 2018 and quickly got sucked down the rabbit hole.
            Around the same time, I got in touch with <a class="body-link" href="https://www.dawex.com/">Dawex</a>, who were developing a B2B data marketplace. During my internship there, I worked on developing the initial
            product concept for a personal data platform. Questions of privacy, data sovereignty and decentralization were never far.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
            Shortly after that, I started exchanging ideas with the team at <a class="body-link" href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a>.
            I was especially interested in the economics of data markets,
            since I had observed at Dawex that a major hurdle to their development was the inability for providers to price their data.
            I ended up interning for 6 months at Ocean to do research on the subject.
            It has been fascinating to see some of the crazy ideas we discussed at the time materialize in the last year,
