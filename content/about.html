                I'm incredibly passionate about climate, computer science, food & wine, climbing, technology and science
                fiction.
                Pick any topic in there and I'm happy to talk hours about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently <a href="mailto:erwinkn@pm.me">on the lookout for opportunities</a> to write code for the climate!
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also been working on a side project called <a href="https://topogether.com">Topogether</a>, an app for outdoor climbing and collaborative cartography.
                It doubles up as my playground around how <a href="/getting-crdts-to-production/">conflict-free replicated data types</a> can make offline collaborative apps easy to build.
