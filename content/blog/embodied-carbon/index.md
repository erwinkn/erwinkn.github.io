We can separate the {{< co2 >}} emissions associated with a building in two categories:
- **Embodied emissions,** coming from the construction process and the materials used.
- **Operational emissions,** coming from the use of a building by its occupants.

Globally, the split of all building sector emissions is 72% coming from operational and 28% coming from embodied carbon.

So far, most of the focus has been on operational emissions. 

Most of the efforts on reducing {{< co2 >}} emissions from buidings have so far focused on operational emissions, that are emitted during the life of a building, as it is used.
