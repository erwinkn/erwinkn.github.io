### Energy efficiency
As mentioned above, most of the energy is consumed during clinker production. Energy efficiency measures therefore mostly focus on improving cement plant processes. While energy efficiency cannot bring us to net-zero by itself, it can deliver {{< co2 >}} emissions reductions that are also cost-effective or have other benefits. 

{{< sidenote-content id=6 >}}Older kilns often operate using so-called "wet" or "semi-wet" processes, where inputs have higher moisture content and additional thermal energy has to be provided to evaporate all the water.{{< /sidenote-content >}}

Major efficiency improvements can be achieved by upgrading older kilns to a state-of-the-art {{< sidenote id=6 >}}dry process{{< /sidenote >}}: modern dry kilns use up to 50% less energy than the long wet kilns that were used in the 70s.[^Scrivener18]

**Beyond those large upgrades, further improvements are unlikely to be very significant:** best available technology (BAT) today already reaches over 60% efficiency compared to the theoretical minimum energy required for clinker production.[^IEA18] **Best-in-class cement kilns actually are some of the most efficient thermal machines in wide-scale industrial use today.**

Small efficiency gains, such as improved use of waste heat, can be important in enabling other projects to become cost-effective, but their effective impact will only be a few percentage points. In fact, other measures, such as increased use of alternative fuels, will likely lead to increased energy use per ton of clinker overall.

Overall, the IEA roadmap for a low-carbon transition in the cement industry[^IEA18] estimates a decrease of 10% in the global average thermal energy use per ton of clinker by 2050, corresponding to 3% of the total {{< co2 >}} emissions reductions required for the cement industry in a 2°C scenario.

### Alternative fuels
The high temperatures required by cement kilns are both a blessing and a curse when it comes to replacing fossil fuels.

On one hand, they allow the incineration of waste that can't be recycled elsewhere in an efficient manner, since the waste ends up providing the thermal energy required for clinker production. Common examples include old tyres, industrial waste, non-recyclable plastics or paper residues or waste oils. This also plugs cement manufacturers into the local circular economy, which has a lot of additional social and economic benefits for the region.

On the other hand, reaching temperatures over 1400°C requires fuels with a high energy density, which most waste types do not have. Achieving levels of 60% or even 80% alternative fuels then requires additional treatment, such as pre-drying, and degrades the thermal efficiency of the cement kiln.

Perhaps surprisingly, **0% fossil fuels in the cement industry is something that will happen very soon** in some parts of the world: I know that Vicat aims to achieve it by 2025 in France and 2030 in Europe, while other manufacturers are on a similar trajectory. Other regions of the world may take longer ; however, this illustrates that the bottleneck is not a technological one, but an economic one, as enough waste with the appropriate properties needs to be collected and supplied locally.

Overall, fuel substitution is an important area of work in the cement industry today and **one of the main levers, alongside clinker substitution, to deliver {{< co2 >}} emissions reductions in the near future** while more transformative technologies, such as carbon capture, are being developed. 


### Clinker substitution
Clinker is not only the major component of cement, but also what provides it with binding power. The clinker ratio, defined as the % of clinker in the final cement blend, is a strong indicator of mechanical strength and durability of the resulting cement, in the absence of other substitution materials.

Replacing clinker therefore requires finding supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that can fulfill the same function of hardening upon hydration. Currently, the main candidates for that role are:

- Fly ash, a by-product of coal plants
- Granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS), a by-product of steel production
- Calcined clays, produced by reacting natural clays at 700-850°C
- Other pozzolanic materials, such as natural volcanic rocks, vegetable ashes or byproducts of silicon production

The first two are the most commonly used clinker alternatives today and are sometimes used up to 50%, or even 70% for GBFS, of the final cement mix. The problem is that they are byproducts of {{< co2 >}} intensive industries and their supply will likely go down in the future, either as the whole industry winds down (in the case of coal) or switches to other processes (in the case of steel).[^IEA18]

Calcined clays seem to be the most promising avenue for sustainable clinker substitution in the long-term. Their geological supply is more than sufficient to cover even a large part of worlwide clinker demand[^Scrivener18] and the cement industry will be able to leverage existing operational knowledge for the calcination process.

{{< figure src="imgs/scrivener18_clinker-substitution.jpg" title="Current use and estimated supply of SCMs and fillers" alt="Current use and estimated supply of SCMs and fillers"  >}}

My mental model for clinker substitution includes two different roles: 
1) **Short term:** an incredibly important lever to deliver strong reductions in the {{< co2 >}} intensity of concrete and cement 
2) **Long term:** a way to mitigate the strong energetic and financial impact of carbon capture, by reducing the amount of expensive clinker required to produce a ton of cement.

However, it is unlikely that we start replacing the majority of clinker with other materials, even by 2050. This is due to a combination of factors, like the uncertain future supply of fly ash and GBFS, the impact on mechanical properties of a high percentage of SCMs and the variations in local conditions, which may make high levels of clinker substitution technically or economically unsustainable. Roadmaps from the IEA[^IEA18] or CEMBUREAU[^CEMBUREAU] estimate a decline of global average clinker ratio from 0.77 to 0.65 by 2050 in their 2°C scenarios.

### Carbon capture
This brings us to the unavoidable elephant on the road to net-zero emissions in the cement industry: carbon capture. 

Let's be clear upfront: if we have to keep on using concrete made from cement that includes a majority of clinker, then **it will be impossible to reach net-zero emissions without capturing the {{< co2 >}} before it reaches the atmosphere.**

{{< sidenote-content id=7 >}}30% vs. 12-15% in a coal plant or 4% in a natural gas plant{{< /sidenote-content >}}

In fact, cement plants are uniquely well-suited for carbon capture: they are large-scale installations with a {{< sidenote id=7 >}}high {{< co2 >}} concentration in the exhaust gases{{< /sidenote >}} and no other way of reducing their process emissions. 

The downside of carbon capture is that it is incredibly expensive, both energetically and financially. Depending on the technology, it would increase thermal or electric demand up to 100% and cost around 50 to 100€ per ton of {{< co2 >}} captured. 

What's more, carbon capture technologies are still immature: estimations of their potential impact on the production process and financial costs are uncertain at best and investments in the billions will be required before they are ready to be brought to market.

Another important question will need to be answered before they can be deployed at scale: what should we do with all the captured {{< co2 >}}?

Geological storage is an option, albeit an expensive one for plants not located near an appropriate site. In any case, heavy subsidies or a very high price on carbon will be required before {{< co2 >}} storage becomes wide-spread in the industry.

Another option is to use it to manufacture some valuable product. The problem here is that the current markets for {{< co2 >}} use are small and won't be able to scale to handle the gigatons of carbon we will need to capture in the future, both in the cement industry and outside.

Nevertheless, exciting projects are happening in the space. To give one of my favorite examples, Vicat aims to develop a pilot cement plant with integrated carbon capture and reuse of waste heat to produce hydrogen through high-temperature electrolysis. The resulting hydrogen could then be used to fuel the kiln, power electric vehicles or even recombined with the captured {{< co2 >}} to produce synthetic fuels able to replace fossil fuels in hard-to-decarbonise industries such as aviation or shipping.

### Novel cements
One might ask: if eliminating emissions from clinker is so hard, why can't we develop other types of cement that don't use clinker?

Such formulations exist and offer varying degrees of emissions reductions potential. I decided not to focus on the topic, as they are subject to various constraints which limit their potential to displace the existing clinker process. If you're interested in the subject, an excellent review can be found in the work of [Scrivener et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884618301480).

To summarize common limitations of alternative cements:
- Nearly all have different or inferior physical properties, which often make them only suitable for relatively small niche markets.
- Some of them rely on pozzolanic materials such as fly ash or GBFS, whose supply is already lacking for their use as clinker substitutes.
- Others are dependent on unproven production processes, which could even result in higher process emissions in some cases, unless some breakthrough is achieved.
- Existing construction standards all rely on the mechanical properties of Portland cement. Testing and approving new materials can take over a decade.

For these reasons, Portland cement will very likely constitute the majority of the market for the foreseeable future. In other words, we will have to find a way to decarbonise the existing clinker production, no matter what.

## Beyond net-zero
There is something very important I have not mentioned until now. Concrete actually captures {{< co2 >}} from the air during its lifetime. Quite a significant amount of it actually.

The reason is simple: the chemical reaction introduced in the [{{< co2 >}} problem](#co2problem) is one side of a triangle.

{{< figure src="imgs/scrivener18_calcium-triangle.jpg" caption="The carbon cycle of concrete ([source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008884618301480))" alt="Diagram showing a triangle of reactions CaCO3 -> CaO -> Ca(OH)2 -> CaCO3" width="80%"  >}}

During clinker production, we take very stable {{< rawhtml >}}CaCO<sub>3</sub>{{< /rawhtml >}} in the form of limestone and turn it at high temperatures into very reactive CaO --- also known as quicklime. Once it is incorporated into the concrete formulation and mixed with water, it rapidly turns into calcium hydrates {{< rawhtml >}}Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>{{< /rawhtml >}} and solidifies.

However, over the lifetime of the resulting structure, those calcium hydrates revert back to the more stable form of {{< rawhtml >}}CaCO<sub>3</sub>{{< /rawhtml >}}, absorbing back the {{< co2 >}} process emissions that were emitted during clinker production.

Concrete used in a building for 80 years will absorb around 20% of the process emissions associated with the clinker it contains.

This carbon uptake can be [further enhanced](https://fastcarb.fr/en/home/) by retrieving the cement contained in the concrete, grinding it into a fine powder and putting it into a {{< co2 >}}-rich atmosphere, where it will absorb another 20 to 25% of process emissions. Through this process, the old cement mineralizes back into rock, that can then be used as aggregates alongside fresh cement to produce new concrete.

{{< figure src="imgs/concrete-cycle.png" caption="Recycling concrete while enhancing CO2 uptake. (icons by [Freepik](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik))">}}

Here's a though experiment: let's assume we achieve close to zero emissions in cement production (as we will have to anyways). If we now factor in the {{< co2 >}} captured over time, the concrete produced from that cement would not just be carbon-neutral: it would be **carbon-negative**.

{{< sidenote-content id=8 >}}For an excellent introduction to negative emissions, I highly recommend Ryan Orbuch's [primer on the subject](https://www.orbuch.com/carbon-removal/){{< /sidenote-content >}}

We know that we will have to {{< sidenote id=8 >}}take {{< co2 >}} directly out of the atmosphere{{< /sidenote >}} if we are to mitigate the worst effects of climate change. One of the big open questions on the subject of large-scale carbon removal is how to store the captured {{< co2 >}} in a permanent manner, in order to definitely remove it from the atmosphere. 

Concrete captures carbon through mineralization and turns it into very stable {{< rawhtml >}}CaCO<sub>3</sub>{{< /rawhtml >}}. Due to higher concentrations, capturing {{< co2 >}} coming out of cement plants is easier than taking it out of the atmosphere and would still enable important, albeit delayed, carbon sequestration in the produced concrete. This means that in the long-term, **concrete could become one of the major sources of carbon sequestration in the world.** 

How's that for a reversal of situation?

## Summing up

Coming back down to Earth, it is necessary to acknowledge that the cement industry has historically been very conservative and slow to change --- for good reasons, but they are not sufficient anymore. The very nature of the production process makes deep {{< co2 >}} emissions reductions especially challenging to achieve and massive investments will be required.

Concrete is one of the most crucial sectors in our transition to a carbon-neutral world and is deeply fascinating --- yet I feel it is often overlooked compared to other areas of interest in the climate fight. I highly encourage many ambitious folks to tackle the subject, both within existing organisations and by building new ones.

I also have to admit that I have been pleasantly surprised by the ongoing work I have discovered from within the industry. The question is not "will we reach net-zero?" anymore, but "how will we do it?"
