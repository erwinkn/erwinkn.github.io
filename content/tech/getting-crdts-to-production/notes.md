# Conflict-free replicated databases (CRDBs)
- Solving relational means we can always downgrade to NoSQL

# Decentralized data migrations

# Designing data structures and invariants

# Authorization and encryption
- https://www.biscuitsec.org/

# Performance and memory
- Least possible amount of data: causal length sets + Lamport timestamps for LWW registers
- In-memory log = compressed format
- Garbage collection

# Master plan
- Implement a CRDB
- Implement advanced data types (arrays, text) as queries over a set
- Add incremental view maintenance (this is the part where I have no idea)
- Add migrations & authorization
- Ship it
- Make it fast and small

# Notes
- CALM theorem and monotonicity: https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt/status/1514293685021814791
- Performant: lowest possible memory footprint, especially in JS (even if code gets ugly)
- Garbage collection:
    - See `crudite` in "Code" section below
    - Braid's Antimatter: https://github.com/braid-org/braidjs/tree/master/antimatter
- Reactive: means you can build your UI / app on top
- Custom language? See CScript
- Incremental: could we have both the data structures, our queries and the UI run as one single incremental computation?
    - automatic incrementalization may make semantics much easier to reason about for users, by allowing them to use sets of operations & just merge them together
- Arbitrary data structures (graphs)
- CRDT database?
    -> [Towards a General Database Management System of Conflict-Free Replicated Relations](https://munin.uit.no/bitstream/handle/10037/22344/thesis.pdf)
- Ability to hook into operation log for sync to a database (e.g. receive creates / updates / deletes / maybe other operations)
- Fast start-up (scalability)
    - Use compressed format as in-memory operation log, to avoid decompression time
- Schema-aware
    - See Cambria
    - Decentralised migrations
    - Backward migrations may not be necessary, _except_ for late updates
    - In this case, delta CRDTs may be especially interesting: a delta is just a piece of state, so a forward migration may be applied to it
- GraphQL compatible?
- Extensible
    - User-defined conflict resolution
    - User-defined operations
    - Move: 
    - Make it easy to create custom CRDTs with domain-specific invariants
    - Framework makes distributed semantics very clear, by detecting concurrent operations
    - Framework takes care of sync

        - Instead of `() => signal() * 2`, do `function memo(arg1) { return arg1() * 2 }; const fn = memo.bind(undefined, signal);`
